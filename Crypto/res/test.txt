I want to become the real star of the show! It has always been nice to work as an actor in this company, but never did they take care of me as they should have. So this is why I decided to leave and show them what it means to be a real professional! Thank you still for everything. I am thankful for all the difficulties we had to overcome together. But now comes the time of my life! This is real! I m gonna be the main actor this time in my next movi, and everyone will be forced to recognize that they should have believed in me more! And that I was nothing but a rough Gem waiting to be polished, ready to shine on the big screen.
